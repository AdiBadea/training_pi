Example 7, Most Robust: Import files in python with the bare import command:

Make a new directory /home/el/foo5/

Make a new directory /home/el/foo5/herp

Make an empty file named __init__.py under herp:

Make a new directory /home/el/foo5/herp/derp

Under derp, make another __init__.py file:

Under /home/el/foo5/herp/derp make a new file called yolo.py Put this in there:

def skycake():
  print "SkyCake evolves to stay just beyond the cognitive reach of " +
  "the bulk of men. SKYCAKE!!"

The moment of truth, Make the new file /home/el/foo5/main.py, put this in there;

from herp.derp.yolo import skycake
skycake()
Run it:

SkyCake evolves to stay just beyond the cognitive reach of the bulk 
of men. SKYCAKE!!
The empty __init__.py file communicates to the python interpreter that the developer intends this directory to be an importable package.
